Repo for FOSS4G:UK Local 2022 logo and map

Howdy all :-)

This repo holds the logo and map for [FOSS4G:UK Local 2022](https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2022local/).

Logo: I have tweaked Joseph's original logo to include the new venues. The new SVG (https://github.com/osgeouk/foss4guk-local-2022-logo-map/blob/main/logo/foss4guk-v2.svg) has the dots in the right place, but my version of Inkscape garbled the text. I will try and splice together a new PNG version tomorrow (on a different machine).

The map folder (https://github.com/osgeouk/foss4guk-local-2022-logo-map/tree/main/map) contains my working QGIS project to a) update the image, and b) create a webmap.

The webmap is a QGIS2Web output from QGIS. It is live at https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2022local/map/index.html, but not linked yet. It needs some more work (to say the least) but is a starting point. Comments / PR, etc. welcome!

Best wishes,
Nick.
